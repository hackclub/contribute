            <p>
              Contributions can happen in a lot of ways. Adding
              <strong>issues</strong>, creating <strong>pull requests</strong>,
              and <strong>reviewing</strong>

              <strong>Fork</strong> the repository
            </a>
            <p>
              A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you
              make changes to a project without affecting the original code. You
              can create this copy by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top
              right of the repository page.

              editor
            </a>
            <p>
              Cloning a repository is how you download the repository's code to
              your computer. You can clone the repository by clicking the green
              "Code" button on the repository page.

              When you're done making your code edits, create a
              <strong>pull request</strong>
            </a>
            <p>
              Pull requests are how you suggest your code edits! The maintainers
              of the repository may comment on your pull request, ask for
              changes, or approve it right away and merge it in.
